The whole game you played like Magnus Carlsen then here you played like Carlos Magnusen, like wut
1300. 1300 is this game, 1300. Uhh, mid-1200 into 1300 is my final guess. And here we go.
1660. 1660. You are telling me a 1600 hung a piece on move 6? YOU ARE TELLING ME THAT A 1600 RATED PLAYER HUNG A PIECE ON MOVE 6, 1600 RATED PLAYER HUNG A PIECE ON MOVE 6, THIS GUY IS 1660 AND HE HUNG A PIECE ON MOVE 6
16, 16, 60 and he hung a piece on move 6! Didn't see a trapped queen, could've trapped the man's queen. Didn't trap the man's queen, could've trapped the man's queen, this man had Rook a4 like 3 moves in a row, didn't even see it. Like when I see the queen come here this is the first thing I think of.
